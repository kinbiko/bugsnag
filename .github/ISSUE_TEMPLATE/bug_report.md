<!-- TRY THIS FIRST:

This package comes with an `InternalErrorCallback` configuration option, which you can use to forward any internal errors to a callback of your choosing. You will be expected to provide logs of the errors that are passed to this callback, if this doesn't explain your problem.

### What exactly did you do?

<!-- Code snippets are preferable here. -->

### What did you expect would happen?

<!-- Be explicit, and if possible, explain why. -->

### What actually happened?

<!-- Please paste any output that you saw in your logs. Make sure you set a InternalErrorCallback configuration option in the constructor, and log all errors that appear here. -->

```console
any output goes here
```
